# How to excute:
```
python3 beehive_csv.py -n nodeID -ds start -de end

nodeID: last four digit of node id
start: 0 means collect data from today (0 day before today)
end: 1 means collect data to yesterday (1 day before today)
```

If you just excute ```python3 beehive_csv.py``` then all live nodes will be shown as a result.
