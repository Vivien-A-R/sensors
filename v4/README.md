# Firmware v4
This firmware works as a form of "get request and send data". Thus if a user wants some data, the user needs to send relevant commands. Codes related to the firmware itself to receive request, collect data, and send the values are in folder "firmare", and the other folder "talker" contains scripts related to send request command, receive data, and decode the binary information.

## Firmware
Firmware version 4 is based on version 3, which means that the sensors that had been on the coresense boards are working the same method. Libraries that have been used for version 2 and 3 are implemented on the new version, so that the type of sensor values are the same with the previous versions. Some of the data are sent as byte values as they are collected from a sensor directly, and some of the sensor values are calculated, such as to temperature in celsius.

Two big difference between this new firmware and the old version are: 1) ability to request specific sensor data when a user wants, and 2) expansibility to use a new sensor without flashing a new firmware if the sensor talks through serial, SPI, I2C (plug-in and play), analog read, and digital read. Serial (Serial1, Serial2, and Serial3), SPI, and I2C on metsense board are available to use with new sensors if they can communicate through one of those communication methods.

When a user collects data from sensors on coreboards, the user can use customized universal I2C function or sensor specific implemented functions. To use the sensor specific functions, wire communication (I2C) is initialized when a coresense boards is powered on. But for Serial and SPI, there are no sensor specific functions but only customized universal serial and SPI function. 

### Flashing firmware
Platformio is used to complie and flash the firmware to coresense boards.

To install platformio using pip:
```
$ pip install -U platformio
```
To flash new Firmware, use command below at where platformio.ini exists:
```
$ platformio run -t upload
```
Or just to compile your code, do:
```
$ platformio run
```

### Commands
Below commands are primary commands. 
```  
ver            to request a coresense firmware version

#### Example commands (see commands above to understand details)
1. To read temperature sensors and get mac address for the coresense boards:
```
$ Coreread tmp112 htu21d pr103j2 tsys01 hih6130 tmp421 mac
```
2. To change mac address for the coresense to 12345 and read the mac again:
```
$ Corewrite mac 12345
$ Coreread mac
```
3. To read Serial3 which is connected to a chemsense board: chemsense board uses pin 47 as a power line, 115200 as baud rate, and I want that Serial3 waits for 4 seconds if there is no data to read.
```
$ Serialconfig 0x03 0x01 0xc2 0x00 0x00 0x0f 0xa0 0x2f
$ Serialread 0x03
```
4. To read SPI which is connected to an alpha sensor: alpha sensor needs 10 ms delay between first command and second command (just one time). Also it sends MSB first, it uses SPI mode1, and slave select pin is connected to GPIO pin 40:
```
$ SPIconfig 0x28 0x07 0xa1 0x20 0x01 0x04
$ SPIread 0x0a 0x01 0x03 0x00 (power on)
$ SPIread 0x0a 0x01 ... (command to read version, serial number, configuration, or histogram)
...
$ SPIread 0x0a 0x01 0x03 0x01 (power off)
```
5. To read tmp112 and HIH6130 through I2C command:
```
/*If the wire communication is initialized. For this firmware,
wire communication is always initialized when the board is powered on.*/`
$ I2Cread 0x48 2
$ I2Cread 0x27 4
```
6. To get node id and firmware version:
```
$ id
$ ver
```
7. To get data reading from analog pin or digital pin:
```
$ analogRead 2
$ digitalRead 33
```

8. To turn on/off a sensor that provides power through a digital pin:
```
$ digitalWrite 47 0  (chemsense board power on)
$ digitalWrite 47 1  (chemsense board power off)
```


#### Reference for data structure (the data comes from firmware)
The data is a line of string: "data <SensorID(1byte)> <data(as much as sensor needs)> "
The first string "data" is to distinguish the data line with other message in talker side (for example error or function end message)

Example:
```
messeges that contains sensor data: "data sensorID data"
e.g.) data 0xC3 BAD=0f030dh2351 SHT=2467 SHH=4555 ...  (chemsense data)
      data 0x01 2456                                   (tmp112 data)
      data 0x28 0x00 0x12 0x..                         (alpha sensor data)
      
messeges:
e.g.) end: next command                                (when a work for a command is finished)
      end: invalid command                             (command invalid)
      err: invalid args                                (node ID and fiemware version are not yet determined)
      ok: Ver 4.0.1                                    (temporal FW version that I put arbitrarily)
```

#### Reference for chemsense data
Information given below is a reference to understand data from the chemsense board. Chemsense board sends 5 different data lines, and each data line is sent in each second. Which means that to collect all the data sent from chemsense boards, the user needs to read Serial3 for 5 continuous times. However for now (07/17/2017), only 3 data lines are valid.

## Talker

Scripts in talker folder have been designed to talk with the new firmware. The talker can use a text file to send command sets, or it can get input. The script will convert some of command inputs to relavent values (Mostly for parameters for configuration and request values. For the details, please refer talker scripts. Some of the commands do not need to be converted..).

### To start talker.py

To start talker.py, do:
```
python3 talker.py -s <port name> -c <command set text file> -r
```
A user has to put a serial device name, which is -s <port name> option. -c option is to import command sets from a text file, from a "command set text file", and -r option is to send the command sets imported from the text file repeatedly.

For example, to connect device at /dev/ttyACM0, to import command sets from a file "cmdset.txt", and to send the commands repeatedly:
```
$ python3 talker.py -s /dev/ttyACM0 -c cmdset.txt -r
```
If a user did not put recursive option, then after sending all command sets, talker mode will be changed to get input.

Or if a user wants to type in some commands:
```
$ python3 talker.py -s /dev/ttyACM0
```



#### Identification numbers

To identify data at talker side, each sensors have each of identification number. The first byte of data sent from firmware is a sensor identification number in hex string:
```
       <sensor name>                   <identification number>
            mac                                 0x00
            tmp112                              0x01
            htu21d                              0x02
            bmp180                              0x03
            pr103j2                             0x04

            spv1840                             0x07
            tsys01                              0x08
            hmc5883l                            0x10
            hih6130                             0x11
            apds9006                            0x12
            tsl260rd                            0x13
            tsl250rd                            0x14
            mlx75305                            0x15
            ml8511                              0x16
            tmp421                              0x17
   
sensor communicate through serial      0xc0|port number (0x01 - 0x03)
sensor communicate through SPI         slave pin number (one of digital pins)
sensor communicate through I2C         address
analog read                            0xa0|pin number (0x02 - 0x03)
digital read                           digital pin number (33 - 40)
```
If an ID is smaller than 0x10, the sensor is on a metsense boards, and if an ID is smaller than 0x20 but greater than 0x0F, the sensor is on a lightsense board. As a sensor name, mac means mac address of coresense boards.



To request data from an alpha sensor, you can send commands below as "command" (see Commands above). The commands will be translated into hex strings by talker:
```
  <command>               <data type>
  power_on              power on the alpha sensor
  power_off             power off the alpha sensor
  serial                collect serial number of the alpha sensor
  version               collect firmware version of the alpha sensor
  config                collect configuration of the alpha sensor
  histogram             collect particle data
  fan_power <power>     change fan power to <power>
  laser_power <power>   change laser power to <power>

  * <power> is an integer number indicates power in range of 0 to 255
```

#### Examples 

1. To read temperature sensors and get mac address for the coresense boards (when a sensor sends multiple values including temperature, temperature value comes first):
```
$ Coreread tmp112 htu21d pr103j2 tsys01 hih6130 tmp421 mac
```
2. To change mac address for the coresense to 12345 and read the mac again:
```
$ Corewrite mac 12345
$ Coreread mac
```
3. To read Serial3 which is connected to a chemsense board: chemsense board uses pin 47 as a power line, 115200 as baud rate, and I want that Serial3 waits for 4 seconds if there is no data to read.
```
$ Serialconfig 3 115200 4000 47
$ Serialread 3
```
4. To read SPI which is connected to a alpha sensor: alpha sensor needs 10 ms delay between first command and second command (just one time). Also it sends MSB first, uses SPI mode1, and slave select pin is connected to GPIO pin 40:
```
$ SPIconfig 40 500000 MSB_first mode1
$ SPIread 10 1 power_on
$ SPIread 10 1 ... (version, serial, config, or histogram)
...
$ SPIread 10 1 power_off
```
5. To read tmp112 and HIH6130 through I2C command:
```
/*If the wire communication is initialized. For this firmware,
wire communication is always initialized when the board is powered on.*/`
$ I2Cread 0x48 2
$ I2Cread 0x27 4
```
6. To get node id and firmware version:
```
$ id
$ ver
```

7. To get data reading from analog pin or digital pin:
```
$ analogRead 2
$ digitalRead 33
```

8. To turn on/off a sensor that provides power through a digital pin:
```
$ digitalWrite 47 0  (chemsense board power on)
$ digitalWrite 47 1  (chemsense board power off)
```
#### Caution
* After you power on the alpha sensor, you'd better wait about 5 second before request data. If not, the values from alpha sensor are not correct values and some nonsenses.
* Alphasense company recommands to do not change laser power because it is adjusted for each sensor after calibration.
