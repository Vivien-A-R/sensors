\subsubsection{Chemsense:}

Chemsense board sends data through Serial3 communication line in metsense board.
All sensor values from chemsense board are caluated in its own firmware.
The raw serial readings from the board are packetized as the raw value as they are collected, and the reading will be sorted out in database.

\paragraph{$\bullet$ Chemsense reading:}
To fully collect all the data from chemsense board, the firmware collect data three times in a row, so that coresense firmware sends three packets when it gets request of reading of chemsense board.

        Byte[0] & Byte[1] & Bytes[Vareis] \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}


\paragraph{$\bullet$ Chemsense firmware configuration:}
\textbf{THIS DATA DO NOT FOLLOW CORESENSE PACKET FORMAT, NO FORMAT AT ALL}
Chemsense Fiwmware configuration is one-time collectable charactor data, when the board is powered on.
The coresense firmware collectes data when the board is powered on, and store the data into an array.
The user can call this data with their own plugin (request and answer collecting functions).
